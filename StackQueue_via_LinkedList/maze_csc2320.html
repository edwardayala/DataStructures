<H2>CSC2320 Data Structures <br> Programming Assignment P3: <br>Solving A Maze</H2></CENTER>

<h3>General Description</h3>
<p>You are about to write a program to solve a maze problem. A maze
can be thought of as an <tt>m x n</tt> grid of cells.  Each cell has 4
sides: north, east, south, and west. A side of the cell is either a complete
wall or a wall with an open door. We use 4 bits (W.S.E.N) to indicate whether or not
a wall has an open door to its adjacent neighbor cell. A bit value of 1 indicates that
there is an open door and a bit value of
0 indicates that there is no door (or a complete wall). For example, a bit pattern of 1001 indicates
that north and west have doors and other two walls don't. Therefore, we can represent this with a single 
integer number (in this case it is 9) in the range <tt>0..15</tt>. In this assignment, we assume that
there is only one entry cell and one exit cell. Basically, you will write a program to find a path
from the entry cell to the exit cell. And then print out the cells (i.e., their coordinates) along the path.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<P>You will solve this maze problem using a stack. You need to implement your own stack using linked list technique.

<P>A maze should be built from a maze data file in the following format:

<P><TT>m n</TT>  //m x n grid of cells
<BR><TT>entry_row entry_column</TT>  //Coordinate for the entry cell
<BR><TT>exit_row exit_column</TT>    //Coordinate for the exit cell
<br>//Open door information for cells
<BR><TT>doors[0][0]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doors[0][1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
doors[0][2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... doors[0][n-1]</TT>
<BR><TT>doors[1][0]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doors[1][1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
doors[1][2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... doors[1][n-1]</TT>
<BR><TT>:</TT>
<BR><TT>doors[m-1][0]&nbsp;&nbsp; doors[m-1][1]&nbsp;&nbsp; doors[m-1][2]&nbsp;
... doors[m-1][n-1]</TT>

<P>where each <tt>cell[i][j]</tt> is an integer number in the range <tt>0..15</tt> representing the
4 bits. The leading bit is for west side of a cell, then followed by
south, east and north sides.

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<P>Basic idea is that for each cell we want
to keep track of the following:

<P><TT>visited&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 1 => the cell has been visited. 0 => not
visited.</TT>
<BR><TT>parent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- the previous cell from which the current cell is reached.</TT>

<P>We start with the entry cell. First create a stack node with the pointer to the
cell as the info of the stack node and then place it on the stack. 
Then we start a loop to explore the maze. The loop stops
when we hit the exit cell or when the stack has no more nodes on it (i.e. empty).
In each iteration, we take the top cell off from the stack. Mark it visited. 
If it is the exit cell, then stop searching.
If not, we continue and place on the stack all the reachable, unvisited adjacent neighbor 
cells of the current cell (i.e. the one just being removed from the stack). 
In the meanwhile, set the current cell as the parent 
 of its adjacent neighbors. The detailed coding hints are provided in the files in the shared drive. 

<P>After the search ends, if the exit cell has not been reached, that means the maze
is not solvable. Just print out a message saying the maze is not solvable.
If the exit cell has been hit, the print out the coordinates of the cells
along the path from the exit cell to the entry cell by backtracking the parents
of the cells on the path.

<h3>Requirements and Submision</h3>
<P>You need to use the header files and client program provided in the shared drive for this programming assignment.
Up completion, zip all the source code and output into a single zip file and submit
to the Blackboard by the deadline.<br>
Happy coding!
